## 🧭 About

I am a data-driven professional transitioning from entrepreneurship into **Data Science, Machine Learning and AI**.

For over 15 years I ran my own stone processing and manufacturing business in Poland, working with B2B clients and international partners. I was responsible for:

- developing and maintaining long-term B2B relationships,  
- pricing, cost analysis and profitability of projects,  
- coordinating production, logistics and quality control,  
- negotiating and delivering contracts end-to-end.

Alongside this, I am also building a second business in visual media –  
**aerial cinematography and video production with FPV drones** – under the brand:

- natural stone : `lumargo.pl`  
- filmmaking & drone studio: `studiofilmowania.pl`  

Over time I realised that many of my business decisions were already **data-driven**:  
I regularly analysed sales trends, seasonality, margins and operational costs in Excel.  
This naturally led me towards **Data Science and AI**, where I can combine:

- practical business understanding,  
- analytical thinking,  
- and modern tools such as **Machine Learning and Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

Today my goal is to grow into roles such as:

- **Junior Data Scientist**,  
- **Junior / Associate Data Analyst**,  
- **AI / LLM Engineer (entry-level)**,  

where I can bring both **hands-on ML skills** and **real business experience** from running a company.

## 🧮 Technical Profile (in progress)

I am actively developing my technical skill set and focusing on **end-to-end projects** rather than only theory.

**Languages & Tools**

- Python – data analysis, ML prototyping  
- SQL – querying of relational data  
- Advanced Excel – financial / operational analysis  
- GitHub – version control and project documentation  
- n8n – low-code orchestration and connecting AI agents with external tools

**Machine Learning (junior level, growing)**

- Supervised learning: classification & regression  
- Model workflow: data cleaning, feature engineering, training, validation, metrics  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `catboost`  
- Experiment tracking: basic use of **MLflow**

**NLP & LLMs**

- Text cleaning, tokenization, TF-IDF and classical ML models for text  
- Practical use of LLM APIs (OpenAI, Gemini) to build:
  - simple chatbots,
  - **AI agents** with tools (tool calling),
  - prototypes of **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) over custom knowledge bases.

I am fully aware that my **technical journey is still at an early stage**, but I am compensating with:

- consistent, structured learning,  
- building real projects,  
- and strong motivation to grow in Data & AI.

## 📁 Portfolio

Below are projects that I am currently developing and documenting.  
They are designed as realistic, business-oriented use cases where I can apply ML and LLMs end-to-end.

---

### 1. Local Expense Analysis – Transaction Categorization

**Goal**

Build a **local, privacy-friendly tool** that analyses personal or small-business bank statements and automatically classifies expenses into meaningful categories.

**What I am working on**

- Parsing and cleaning transaction data (CSV / XLS exports from banks) with **Python & pandas**  
- Designing rule-based mappings for merchants and transaction descriptions (e.g. merchant → category)  
- Experimenting with **ML models** to classify transactions based on text description, amount and merchant  
- Aggregating results into simple reports: monthly spending by category, trends, top merchants

**Tech stack**

- Python, pandas, scikit-learn  
- Local CSV files, Jupyter notebooks  
- First experiments with MLflow for tracking model versions

**Why this project matters**

- It reflects a real-world use case that I personally face as an entrepreneur  
- It combines **data cleaning, feature engineering, ML modelling and reporting**  
- It is a solid practical exercise in building an end-to-end pipeline on local data

### 2. AI Agents for Clients – Product Search & Knowledge Assistant

**Goal**

Design an **AI agent** that can support customers of a small/medium business by:

- searching over a structured product catalog (e.g. stones, headstones, countertops),  
- answering detailed questions from a **knowledge base** (materials, dimensions, installation, maintenance),  
- integrating with a **calendar** to propose and schedule consultations.

**What I am working on**

- Defining the *orchestrator agent* prompt and decision logic  
- Implementing tools (API endpoints) for:
  - `search` – product search with filters (category, material, color, etc.),  
  - `answer` – question-answering over a knowledge base (documentation, FAQs),  
  - calendar tools – reading and creating events for meetings with clients.  
- Integrating everything inside **n8n**:
  - chat/agent nodes using OpenAI / Gemini,  
  - HTTP Request nodes (Search & Answer),  
  - structured workflows combining multiple agents (calendar + knowledge).  
- Experimenting with **RAG**: storing company knowledge in a vector database and using LLMs to generate helpful, grounded answers.

**Tech stack**

- n8n (self-hosted orchestration)  
- OpenAI / Gemini APIs for LLM reasoning  
- HTTP endpoints for search & answer tools  
- Vector database for knowledge retrieval (e.g. Pinecone / Chroma – under evaluation)

**Why this project matters**

- It matches my real business context (stone products and services for clients)  
- It shows how **LLMs and agents** can bring value to traditional industries  
- It is a good foundation to grow into **AI Engineer / LLM Engineer** roles

## 🎓 Education & Training

**Formal Education**

- Postgraduate Studies – **Data Science in Business**  
  Nicolaus Copernicus University, Toruń  
- MSc – **Management Information Systems**  
  Nicolaus Copernicus University, Toruń  

**Selected Courses**

- DataWorkshop – Practical Machine Learning  
- DataWorkshop – Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- DataWorkshop – Practical LLMs  
  - building LLM-powered apps,  
  - RAG and agents,  
  - ML pipelines in practice.

I treat these as a **starting point**, not as proof of being “finished”.  
I am continuously revisiting the material and re-implementing concepts in my own projects.

## 🚀 What I am looking for

I am currently looking for opportunities where I can:

- contribute to **data-driven decision making**,  
- grow under more experienced Data Scientists / ML Engineers,  
- and gradually take ownership of end-to-end analytical or AI projects.

I am especially interested in:

- **Junior Data Analyst / Junior Data Scientist** roles,  
- early-stage AI/ML teams that work with **LLMs and agents**,  
- companies that value both **technical skills** and **business thinking**.
